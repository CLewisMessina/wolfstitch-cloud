### **Core wolfcore Library Architecture**
```python
wolfcore/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py                 # Main API exports
â”œâ”€â”€ parsers.py                  # File format handling (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ cleaner.py                  # Text preprocessing and normalization
â”œâ”€â”€ chunker.py                  # Intelligent text chunking algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ tokenizer_manager.py        # Tokenizer abstraction layer
â”œâ”€â”€ processor.py                # Main processing orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ session_manager.py          # Stateless session handling
â”œâ”€â”€ model_database.py           # AI model specifications and metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                    # Shared utilities and helpers
â””â”€â”€ exceptions.py               # Custom exception classes

# Simple, chainable API design
from wolfcore import Wolfstitch

# One-line processing
result = Wolfstitch.process_file(
    "document.pdf",
    tokenizer="gpt-4",
    max_tokens=1024,
    format="jsonl"
)

# Step-by-step processing
wf = Wolfstitch()
parsed = wf.parse("document.pdf")
cleaned = wf.clean(parsed.text, format=parsed.format)
chunks = wf.chunk(cleaned, max_tokens=1024, tokenizer="gpt-4")
result = wf.export(chunks, format="jsonl")
```

### **Progressive Enhancement in Cloud**
Maintain the desktop app's innovative progressive loading in the web version:

```javascript
// Frontend: Progressive enhancement
const [tokenizers, setTokenizers] = useState(['word-estimate']); // Start basic
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  // Start with immediate functionality
  setIsLoading(false);
  
  // Load premium tokenizers in background
  loadPremiumTokenizers().then(premiumTokenizers => {
    setTokenizers(prev => [...prev, ...premiumTokenizers]);
  });
}, []);
```
